# Stormmore Monitor

## What is it ?
It's application to monitor hardware for gamers/overclockers. 
Made it for myself to check how my cooling behave during playing games. There is similar software but none which
meet my expectations. It allows to change look and feel - where informations are rendered and change it. 
Most important think is that it shows temperature, CPU/GPU usage and FPS. 

## How to run it ?
Install or download ZIP and run :) 
In system tray you can find icon to change settings etc. You can hide/show overlay by using combination of 
keys (ctrl + alt + .), very helpful when you want to record gameplay without leaving game and switching off app.

## What's next ? 
Right now it has only basic features like showing temperature, usage and FPS.
I'm planning to add other indicators ssd usage, voltages, frequency, power consumption and many more.
